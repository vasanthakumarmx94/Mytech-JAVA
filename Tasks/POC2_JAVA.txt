Days - 4-5 days

Learn & Implement Spring Security:
1. Normal Security 
2. Authentication & authorization 
3. oauth 
4. oauth2  
5. JWT

1) Create a spring boot application student-api
2) Connect student-api with mysql db
3) Need to create a student form with parameters below:
		
	-first name
	-last name
	-mobile number
	-email address
	-project	
 
 4) Project should be stored in their respective table (projid, projname, duration)
 (A student can work on more than one project. Student and Project are entities here)
 5) Map this table with student master table	
 6) Create 3 APIs Insert, getAll,findByStudentId
 7) Student user only allowed to do insert and admin can perform all operations
  
 ** important **
 code quality should be maintained
 mappings should be in proper form
 create a proper structure with proper naming conventions
